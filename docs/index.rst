Overview
========
Ranger is a Python package for manipulating Range data. Here, a Range refers
to a contiguous set within a comparable domain. For instance, the letters a-c could be
a Range, as could the integers -1-10, the floats 0.5-0.7, or the dates 7/4/2014-7/20/2014. 

In addition to supplying functions for dealing with single Ranges, Ranger includes collections
to manipulate sets of Ranges, along with mappings of Ranges to single or multiple objects. The 
underlying logic of Ranger was inspired by the Range object in the 
`Google Guava <https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/>`_ library. However, Ranger includes
a number of Pythonic features that are unavailable within Java.
